I started teaching myself the basics of Javascript in December 2023 a few months before starting the CFG degree.
I have so far created projects using SQL and Python. I aim to continue improving my learning as the course progresses.

## About our project

The "I Need a Pet" project was started by our non-profit organisation in collaboration with the 'Rescue Buttons' animal shelter. 
We started the project in the hopes that we can afford customers the opportunity to experience pet ownership without the 
need for long-term commitment. Through the 'PetPal Haven', customers have a choice of a variety of different pets to 
care for their chosen time period. Should customers develop a special bond with their chosen pet and wish to provide them with a more permanent 
home, we are able to facilitate the adoption process.
