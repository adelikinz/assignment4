<summary> My Tech journey </summary>
before joining the CFG Degree Spring course I actually never wrote code before. for years before I was always put off 
as I thought it looked complicated. Early December I was encouraged to give it a try and I started by researching 
and reading basic guides on python. this then developed a passion and made me look for ways to pursue education further.

## About our project

The "I Need a Pet" project was started by our non-profit organisation in collaboration with the 'Rescue Buttons' animal shelter. 
We started the project in the hopes that we can afford customers the opportunity to experience pet ownership without the 
need for long-term commitment. Through the 'PetPal Haven', customers have a choice of a variety of different pets to 
care for their chosen time period. Should customers develop a special bond with their chosen pet and wish to provide them with a more permanent 
home, we are able to facilitate the adoption process.

## Our files

#### .gitignore
A .gitignore file tells git which files, directories or patterns in your project to ignore and not to track.  
The .gitignore file is created with a `.` at the beginning.  
Each line the .gitignore file indicates a new file, folder or pattern to ignore.  
A .gitignore file is usually located and found in the root directory of the project or repository.
  
#### requirements.txt
requirements.txt is a text file that lists all the packages, modules and libraries that the project needs to run. 
Or, in other words, it lists the projects dependencies.  
Within this file the dependencies can have a specified version listed that the project has used.
The syntax is displayed as: `flask==3.0.3`  
To install the necessary project dependencies in your virtual environment you can use:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
Once the packages are installed you can import them into your files.
